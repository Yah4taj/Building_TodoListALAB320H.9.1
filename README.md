* Build To Do list for business startup

** Used the useReducer hook to manage state with reducer functions.
  Use useState in places where reducers are not appropriate or necessary.
  Implemented controlled forms and inputs.
 

*** Some issues were encountered with the edit and delete task functionality at the top portion of the app. However, the bottom portions are functioning allowing for task items to be  saved when edit is clicked and canceled to reverse the action. Completed checked box items receive a strikethrough to indicate completion. Tasks may be added via the top portion input. 

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
